# JetSetGo
A Capstone + passion project


JetSetGo has been a long time coming. Traveling is a very strong passion of mine and for years I have been wanting to put my experience and expertise on travel into services that could help like minded people. At JetSetGo we have a thirst for adventure and wandering the earth to see all it has to offer. With what little time we have left in this world, what better way to spend less time researching and more time exploring! Whether you're an adrenaline junkie or have a taste for the finer things, take our survey so that we can build a custom itinerary just for you!
